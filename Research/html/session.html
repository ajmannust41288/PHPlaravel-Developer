        The International Union of Food,&#128512; Agricultural, Hotel,&#128513; Restaurant, Catering, Tobacco and Allied
        Workers Associations (IUF) &#128584;&#128520; &#x20; is a global
        trade (labour) union federation representing workers in
        agriculture; the processing and manufacture of food and drink; hotels, restaurants, tourism and
        catering services, and tobacco processing. With national trade unions affiliates, representing a
        combined membership of over 12 million workers in 120 countries, the IUF organises workers
        throughout the global food chain or from 'plough to plate'.
        The IUF secretariat is in Geneva, Switzerland, with regional offices in Brussels, Belgium
        (Europe); Montevideo, Uruguay (Latin America); Barbados (the Caribbean); Nairobi, Kenya
        (Africa); and Sydney, Australia (Asia/Pacific).
        The IUF is operated for and by its affiliated unions. Each member union can send delegates to
        the IUF Congress, held every five years. Congress determines policies and lays down guidelines

        Vice-Presidents and the General Secretary, adopts all changes in IUF Rules, and admits new
        affiliates.
